					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of issues with this lab, but near all of them were brought upon myself. I found multiple different websites I liked, and took the HTML and CSS and collaged them together into some strange conglomerate. Overall, it worked really well!!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I faced issues with importing images into my page and correctly sizing them, as well as properly formatting the button tools. For the first problem, it was just an issue of linking my CSS sheet. For the second, I wasn't able to understand nesting classes and tags. I used W3Schools, which helped a lot!!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I may have put an embarrasing amount of effort into this assignment, but I had so much fun that I don't care! I've been working on it non-stop for the past few days, and I managed to really learn a lot through making a lot of mistakes! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, I learned a lot about code and how it works! This class feels much less stressful as a result:0</p>
