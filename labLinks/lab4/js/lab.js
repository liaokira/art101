  // Start with no money and the turkey healthy.
//Keep Going Until Something Happens: 
  //Keep track of how much money you have and how much health the turkey has.
  //If you have enough money or the turkey's health runs out, stop.
//During Each Round: 
  //Check how much money you have and how healthy the turkey is.
  //If you want to punch the turkey, go ahead.
  //If you punch, the turkey loses some health, and you earn some money.
// End of the Game
  //If you've earned enough money, hooray! You win.
  //If the turkey's health drops to zero, you've won as well.
//The End
